This is the code repository for [Federated Learning with Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/federated-learning-with-python/9781803247106?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781803247106), published by Packt.

**Design and implement a federated learning system and develop applications using existing frameworks**

## What is this book about?
Federated learning (FL) is a paradigm-shifting technology in AI that enables and accelerates machine learning (ML), allowing you to work on private data. It has become a must-have solution for most enterprise industries, making it a critical part of your learning journey. This book helps you get to grips with the building blocks of FL and how the systems work and interact with each other using solid coding examples.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Discover the challenges related to centralized big data ML that we currently face along with their solutions
* Understand the theoretical and conceptual basics of FL
* Acquire design and architecting skills to build an FL system
* Explore the actual implementation of FL servers and clients
* Find out how to integrate FL into your own ML application
* Understand various aggregation mechanisms for dive
